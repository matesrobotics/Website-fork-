I'm gonna get Charlie to move the actual repository to the organization later so we have the real thing and not a forked version of it.

But basically here's the website so far. The plan is to work on it a bunch over the break and hopefully have a barebones functional one by the competition. It's not a priority, though, the robot should definitely come first. 

And there's obviously a lot of problems at the moment, lol.
